-- 042_admin_account.sql
--
-- Endpoints onboarded with an existing admin account instead of the setup
-- script (CyberArk calls this a reconcile account).
--
-- An administrator gives an account that already exists on the machine and
-- can use sudo -- its username and password, or private key. The credential is
-- kept in the vault (kind admin_credential, never shown again) and the
-- endpoint's access_mode becomes 'admin'. A bootstrap job then has the gateway
-- log in with it and install the Authnull helper and the grant-key sshd
-- setting through sudo -- the setup script without its authnull-svc account.
-- From then on every job on that endpoint logs in as the admin account and
-- runs the helper through sudo; endpoints set up with the script keep
-- access_mode 'svc' and work as before.
--
-- Numbered 042, following 041_managed_accounts.sql. Safe to run repeatedly.

-- This file owns the full kind lists of vault_secrets and gateway_jobs. Every migration is
-- replayed in order on each boot, so an earlier file that re-added its own shorter list would
-- reject rows of a later kind and, under set -e, stop every migration after it (024 to 041 used
-- to do exactly that). To add a kind, extend the list here, or move these statements to the new
-- file and delete them here: never leave two files setting the same constraint.
