-- SSH grants, in each ORGANISATION database: one policy's hold on one account
-- on one endpoint, and the credential issued for it.
--
-- A GRANT'S LIFE
--
--   pending  -> active    the gateway installed a fresh key for the account and
--                         the control plane stored it (vault + sealed grant key).
--   pending  -> failed    the install job ran out of attempts.
--   any      -> disabled  replaced by a newer grant for the same account, or its
--                         policy was edited or deleted. A disabled grant that was
--                         active gets a revoke job, which removes its key.
--
-- ONE ACTIVE GRANT PER ACCOUNT PER ENDPOINT
--
-- The partial unique index makes two live grants for one account on one machine
-- unrepresentable. A new grant for the same account replaces the old one -- the
-- previous holder loses it, and the new install overwrites the key.
--
-- THE GRANT KEY
--
-- The account's private key is stored in the vault (kind grant_key) already
-- encrypted under a per-grant key K. K itself is kept here, sealed under a key
-- derived from ENCRYPTION_KEY with a label distinct from the vault's. A stolen
-- vault table alone yields nothing; step 7 releases K for one session only after
-- MFA approval.
--
-- ALSO IN THIS MIGRATION
--
--   * revoke_credential joins the job kinds, so removing a key never collides
--     with the install job of the grant it removes.
--   * "one open job per endpoint and kind" becomes per endpoint, kind and
--     ACCOUNT (from the job payload), so granting two accounts on one machine
--     queues two jobs. Scan jobs carry no account and keep their old behaviour.
