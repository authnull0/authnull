-- Logging in with a rotated password through the gateway, in each
-- ORGANISATION database.
--
-- A password policy's login_method says what its passwords are for:
--
--   'password' -- the gateway opens sessions to these accounts with the vaulted
--                 password, released once per approved session exactly as a
--                 grant key is (sshgrants.ReleaseForDecision). The operator
--                 never sees it, and Endpoint Policies install no key for
--                 these accounts: one credential per account.
--   'none'     -- rotation and break-glass reveal only; sessions use keys.
--
-- Every managed endpoint also gets an sshd rule from its helper (version 4):
-- password SSH only from its gateway's address, root never by password. Its
-- state, as last applied by a scan, is epm_machines.password_ssh.
--
-- Numbered 036, following 035_password_rotation.sql. Safe to run repeatedly.
