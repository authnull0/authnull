-- Unified push-MFA device registry.
--
-- WHY: push MFA is needed for AD/domain login AND for platform (console/SSC)
-- login, but each flow had its own device store, its own enrollment token store
-- and its own invite email:
--
--   AD        did.ad_mfa_enrollments  -> did.ad_user_devices.expo_push_token
--   platform  did.mfa_methods.method_data.enrollment_token
--                                     -> did.mfa_methods.method_data.expo_push_token
--
-- One phone therefore had to enrol twice, and when Expo reported the token dead
-- only whichever flow noticed deactivated its own copy -- the other kept pushing
-- into the void indefinitely.
--
-- WHY THESE TABLES ARE KEYED ON THE DEVICE, NOT THE USER: the two sides do not
-- share a user identity. did.ad_users (email_id / mail / user_principal_name,
-- often a non-routable UPN like user@corp.local) and did.users (email_address,
-- the console signup address) are separate tables in the same id space, and the
-- same human can legitimately have different addresses in each. Keying a shared
-- registry on user_id would be wrong and keying it on email would silently
-- create two rows again.
--
-- The physical device is the join key: the Expo push token is issued by the app
-- on the phone and is identical no matter which flow enrolled it. So
-- mfa_devices holds one row per (org, push token), and mfa_device_identities
-- links any number of identities to it. When the same phone enrols from the
-- second flow the device row already exists and only a link is added -- one
-- device, one push, and one deactivation that covers every identity.
--
-- Deep links are deliberately NOT unified here: installed apps still open
-- authnull://ad-enroll and authnull://mfa-push-enroll. Both now resolve to the
-- same token store, so the app can move to a single scheme whenever it ships
-- without a server change.
--
-- Idempotent: this file is replayed against the master and every org database on
-- every boot (see docker-compose.yml). Every statement is CREATE IF NOT EXISTS
-- or an ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING backfill.

-- such phones are different devices, not one. This replaced the full index
-- mfa_devices_org_transport_token_uq, which 046 drops. It is created HERE, not in 046,
-- because the backfills below rely on it to skip duplicates, and because this file is
-- replayed on every boot: re-creating the old full index here would fail the replay as
-- soon as two tokenless phones exist.
--
-- The backfills use ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING without a target, so they skip a row that
-- clashes with ANY unique index. On the first boot after an upgrade the old and new
-- indexes both exist until 046 runs, and a target naming only one of them would fail on
-- the other.
