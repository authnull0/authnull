-- 049: per-domain credentials for the AD DC sensor.
--
-- Lives in each org's database, like 021_gateway_credentials, and follows the same scheme: a
-- client id and secret are issued when an admin downloads sensor.yml for a domain, the secret is
-- stored only as a SHA-256 hash, and the sensor trades the pair for a short-lived bearer token
-- at /ad/sensor/token.
--
-- A domain may hold several live credentials: it usually has several domain controllers, each
-- running its own sensor with the file downloaded for it. A credential stops working when its
-- domain is deleted or when revoked_at is set.
--
-- Separate from did.gateway_credentials on purpose: those are bound to a PAM jump server, and
-- the PAM gateway auth path stays untouched.
--
-- Replayed on every start (see docker-compose.yml): everything here is IF NOT EXISTS.
