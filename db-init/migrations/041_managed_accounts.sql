-- 041_managed_accounts.sql
--
-- Managed temporary accounts: a named local account an administrator creates
-- on an endpoint for a fixed time -- a contractor's or a vendor's -- with a
-- vaulted, rotated password, deleted when the time is up.
--
-- Creating one records a did.managed_accounts row and queues a
-- managed_account_add job. The gateway has the endpoint helper create the
-- account (marked as Authnull's by its GECOS field, with a throwaway random
-- password nobody sees) and schedule its own removal at the expiry. When the
-- gateway reports it created, the account joins the rotation profile chosen
-- for it (did.password_accounts, credential 'password') and its first
-- rotation is queued at once: from then on the password is the vault's, the
-- gateway logs in with it, and a reveal works as for any rotated account.
--
-- At the expiry -- or when an administrator removes it -- a
-- managed_account_del job deletes the account from the endpoint; its vaulted
-- password is retired and it leaves its profile.
--
-- Numbered 041, following 040_temp_users.sql. Safe to run repeatedly.
