-- Recording storage, in each ORGANISATION database: where an organisation's SSH
-- session recordings are kept, and how each recording got there.
--
-- WHY
--
-- Ingest (018) writes every recording to the control plane's own volume. That
-- is one disk, sized by whoever installed the service, holding evidence that
-- grows without bound. Customers keep evidence in their own object store --
-- S3 (or anything that speaks its API: MinIO, Wasabi, Ceph) or Google Cloud
-- Storage -- under their own retention, locks and encryption.
--
-- HOW A RECORDING MOVES
--
--   1. Ingest writes it to the local volume, as before, and marks it
--      offload_state = 'pending' when the organisation stores elsewhere.
--   2. The offloader uploads it, checks the stored size, and points the row at
--      the object (storage_backend, storage_bucket, storage_object). Only then
--      is the local copy deleted; local_delete_pending covers a crash between
--      the two, so a copy is never orphaned on the volume.
--   3. A failed upload is retried, 30s doubling to 5 minutes, without limit: a
--      bucket that is down for a day loses nothing, it only delays.
--   4. A local copy that no longer matches its ingest digest is never uploaded
--      ('held'): copying altered evidence into the archive would launder it.
--
-- storage_key keeps its meaning -- <org>/<jump server>/<recording>.cast, the
-- recording's identity and the key ingest's upsert matches on -- whichever
-- backend holds the bytes.
--
-- CREDENTIALS
--
-- Never in this table. Either the service's own cloud identity is used
-- ('ambient': an instance role, workload identity, environment), or the
-- credential is sealed in the vault (022) as kind 'storage_credential', at
-- endpoint 0 -- it belongs to the organisation, not to an endpoint.
--
-- Numbered 029, following 028_endpoint_decommission.sql. Safe to run repeatedly.
